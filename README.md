# FT900 IoT Demo applications

This contains IoT demo applications for FT900 series of microcontrollers. 

#### FT900 AWS IoT Demo
- This demonstrates secure MQTT connectivity to Amazon AWS IoT Core and AWS Greengrass using MQTT library from Amazon FreeRTOS.
- This was made after I successfully integrated mbedTLS open-source library with optimal settings for memory footprint.

#### FT900 IoT Cloud Demo
- This demonstrates secure MQTT connectivity to IoT cloud services: Amazon AWS IoT Core, Google Cloud IoT Core, Microsoft Azure IoT Hub.
- This is currently under development.
