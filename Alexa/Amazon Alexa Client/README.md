# FT900 Alexa Demo


This PoC application demonstrates using FT900 microcontroller as an Amazon Echo Dot device, where users can issue voice commands to Alexa and hear Alexa’s voice responses generated by Alexa’s complex speech recognition and natural language processing in the cloud. To make this possible, FT900 (Alexa client) communicates with a Raspberry PI 3B+ (Alexa gateway), which relays voice requests and voice responses to and from the Alexa cloud. The RPI runs a customized version of Amazon’s official open-source Alexa Voice Service (AVS) SDK, written in C++.

This demo is targeted for FTDI/Bridgetek’s smart home devices, PanL Hub and PanL Display. Having Alexa built-in to PanL products allow customers to talk directly to Alexa via PanL without needing to buy Amazon Echo devices. PanL Hub, which runs on RPI, acts as the Alexa Gateway while the PanL Display, which runs on FT900 microcontroller, acts as the Alexa Client. Customers will be able to use both PanL Hub and PanL Display to issue voice commands and operations to Alexa.

### Audio Processing 

Below is a description of how the audio is processed on FT900.

avs_record_request()
- Audio recorded (from mic): 16-bit PCM, 16KHZ, stereo (2-channels)
- Audio saved (to SD card): 16-bit PCM, 16KHZ, mono (1-channel)

avs_send_request()
- Audio read (from SD card): 16-bit PCM, 16KHZ, mono (1-channel)
- Audio sent (to RPI):  8-bit u-law, 16KHZ, mono (1-channel)

avs_recv_response()
- Audio received (from RPI): 8-bit u-law, 16KHZ, mono (1-channel)
- Audio saved (to SD card): 16-bit PCM, 16KHZ, mono (1-channel)

avs_play_response()
- Audio read (from SD card): 16-bit PCM, 16KHZ, mono (1-channel)
- Audio played (to speaker): 16-bit PCM, 16KHZ, stereo (2-channels)

Notes
- G711 u-law companding (compression/expanding) algorithm is used to convert data stream from 16-bit to 8-bit and vice versa. Compressing the data before transmission reduces the data bandwidth by half.
- Converting stereo data stream to mono data stream is a matter of removing alternating 16-bit WORD.


# RPI-side (Alexa Gateway)

Amazon provides an official Alexa Voice Service (AVS) SDK, (written in C++) https://github.com/alexa/avs-device-sdk. The version I am using is AVS SDK is v1.11.0, (12-19-2018). Instructions to install the AVS SDK on RPI can also be found on the github link.


Below is a block diagram showing the implemented and modified components of the RPI application.

### Modifications to AVS SDK 

The primary modifications for the AVS SDK application are contained in PortAudioMicrophoneWrapper class and SpeechSynthesizer classes.
- PortAudioMicrophoneWrapper: PortAudioCallback() contains the data stream for Alexa request
- SpeechSynthesizer: startPlaying() contains the data stream for Alexa response


### Audio Processing 

Below is a description of how the audio is processed on RPI.

avs_request()
- Audio received (from FT900): 8-bit u-law, 16KHZ, mono (1-channel)
- Audio sent (to Alexa cloud): 16-bit PCM, 16KHZ, mono (1-channel)

avs_response()
- Audio received (from Alexa cloud): MP3
- Audio sent (to FT900): 8-bit u-law, 16KHZ, mono (1-channel)

Notes
- G711 u-law companding (compression/expanding) algorithm is used to convert data stream from 16-bit to 8-bit and vice versa. Compressing the data before transmission reduces the data bandwidth by half.
- SOX utility is used to convert MP3 data stream to raw PCM16 data stream.


# Action items

Below are the action items for the Alexa Demo.
1. Support for wake-word detection
2. Use 8KHz instead of 16KHz to reduce audio file size by half. (However, note that RPI will have to convert the 8KHz to 16KHz as Alexa cloud requires 16KHz).
3. Performance/speed optimization
4. Support for alarms or notification-based messages. (Currently, only responses triggered by requests are supported.)
5. Support for very long Alexa responses. (Need to test requests that have very long responses.)
6. Support for queuing Alexa requests from multiple FT900 clients. (Multiple FT900 can simultaneously send requests to RPI. RPI should queue the requests and only issue a request when a response for previous request is processed.)
7. RPI should not play response on its speaker when the request is from FT900.
8. Audio decoding implementation currently uses bash scripts using SOX utility. (Should be replaced with C/C++ code)
9. Upgrade to latest AVS SDK version. Currently using AVS SDK 1.11.0, (12-19-2018). As of today, the latest version is AVS SDK 1.12.0 (02-28-2019).
