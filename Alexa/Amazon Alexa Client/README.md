# FT900 Alexa Demo


This PoC application demonstrates using FT900 microcontroller as an Amazon Echo Dot device, where users can issue voice commands to Alexa and hear Alexa’s voice responses generated by Alexa’s complex speech recognition and natural language processing in the cloud. To make this possible, FT900 (Alexa client) communicates with a Raspberry PI 3B+ (Alexa gateway), which relays voice requests and voice responses to and from the Alexa cloud. The RPI runs a customized version of Amazon’s official open-source Alexa Voice Service (AVS) SDK, written in C++.
