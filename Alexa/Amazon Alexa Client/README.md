# FT900 Alexa Demo


This PoC application demonstrates using <b>FT900 microcontroller</b> (MCU) as an <b>Amazon Echo Dot</b> device, 
where users can issue voice commands to Alexa and hear Alexa’s voice responses generated by Alexa’s complex speech recognition and natural language processing in the cloud. 
To make <b>Alexa on MCU</b> possible, FT900 (Alexa client) communicates with a <b>Raspberry PI 3B+</b> (Alexa gateway), which relays voice requests and voice responses to and from the Alexa cloud. 
The RPI runs a customized version of Amazon’s official open-source <b>[Alexa Voice Service (AVS) SDK](https://github.com/alexa/avs-device-sdk)</b>, written in C++.

This demo is targeted for <b>FTDI/Bridgetek’s</b> existing smart home devices, <b>PanL Hub</b> and <b>PanL Display</b>. 
Having <b>[Alexa built-in](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-voice-service)</b> to <b>PanL Smart Home</b> allow customers to talk directly to Alexa via PanL without needing to buy Amazon Echo devices. 
Customers will have access to the <b>built in capabilities of Alexa</b> (like ask informations, play music/live news/audio book and set timers/alarms/notifications) including access to third-party skills (such as control smart home devices).

PanL Hub, which runs on RPI, acts as the <b>Alexa Hub/Gateway</b> while the PanL Display, which runs on FT900 microcontroller, acts as the <b>Alexa Client</b>. 
Customers will be able to use both PanL Hub and PanL Display to issue voice commands and operations to Alexa.


# FT900-side (Alexa Client)

Below is a block diagram showing the implemented components of the FT900 application.
<img src="https://github.com/richmondu/FT900/blob/master/Alexa/Amazon%20Alexa%20Client/docs/images/block_diagram.jpg" width="623"/>

      - SD Card should be replaced with SPI Flash or I2C EEPROM on PanL display.
      - RTC library is used to measure time elapsed for performance measurement.
      - Button is implemented as GPIO and UART. User can choose between the two.

Below is a sequence diagram showing the basic interaction of components of the FT900 application.
<img src="https://github.com/richmondu/FT900/blob/master/Alexa/Amazon%20Alexa%20Client/docs/images/sequence_diagram.jpg" width="623"/>


### FT900 Alexa AVS library

The main component of the Alexa Demo on the FT900 side is the Alexa AVS library. I created the library to be reusable (for PanL Display) and easy to use (abstract the audio, the SD card and the network communication). SD Card should be replaced with SPI Flash or I2C EEPROM. The main functions include:

      - avs_connect() - Establish connection with RPI
      - avs_disconnect() - Closes connection with RPI
      - avs_record_request() - Record voice request from microphone and save to SD card
      - avs_send_request() - Read voice request from SD card and send to RPI
      - avs_receive_response() - Receive voice response from RPI and save to SD card
      - avs_play_response() - Play voice response from SD card
      - avs_recv_and_play_response() - Receive and play voice response from RPI without saving to SD card (faster performance)
      - avs_recv_and_play_response_threaded() - Receive and play voice response from RPI in separate threads using overlapping io. 
      - avs_set_volume()
      - avs_init()
      - avs_free()

As you can see, there are three ways to process Alexa response. The first is the basic implementation while the 2nd and 3rd improves user experience by reducing delay or the waiting time to hear Alexa's response.

      1. Receive and play response by completely receiving all data and save to memory before starting to play it.
      2. Receive and play response immediately segment by segment.
      3. Receive and play response in separate threads by utilizing some overlapped memory.

### Wakeword Detection

The demo currently does not support Wakeword detection. To trigger FT900 to start recording voice, user has to press down a button. To stop recording, user has to release the button. This works similar to the remote control for Amazon's Firestick TV.

The demo provides two ways to trigger voice recording:

      - UART Mode: Press 't' key on UART terminal
      - GPIO Mode: Press hardware button connected to GPIO 31

To support Wakeword detection feature on FT900, external MCUs can be integrated as slave devices to handle wakeword detection. 
[SparkFun's board](https://petewarden.com/2019/03/07/launching-tensorflow-lite-for-microcontrollers/) is an example board that can be used for wakeword detection.


### Audio Processing 

The format of audio received by FT900 from RPI is raw/PCM format.
RPI performs the decoding to raw/PCM from MP3, AAC or other formats.

Below is a description of how the audio is processed on FT900.

      avs_record_request()
      - Audio recorded (from mic): 16-bit PCM, 16KHZ, stereo (2-channels)
      - Audio saved (to SD card): 16-bit PCM, 16KHZ, mono (1-channel)

      avs_send_request()
      - Audio read (from SD card): 16-bit PCM, 16KHZ, mono (1-channel)
      - Audio sent (to RPI): 8-bit u-law, 16KHZ, mono (1-channel)

      avs_recv_response()
      - Audio received (from RPI): 8-bit u-law, 16KHZ, mono (1-channel)
      - Audio saved (to SD card): 16-bit PCM, 16KHZ, mono (1-channel)

      avs_play_response()
      - Audio read (from SD card): 16-bit PCM, 16KHZ, mono (1-channel)
      - Audio played (to speaker): 16-bit PCM, 16KHZ, stereo (2-channels)

      avs_recv_and_play_response()
      - Audio received (from RPI): 8-bit u-law, 16KHZ, mono (1-channel)
      - Audio played (to speaker): 16-bit PCM, 16KHZ, stereo (2-channels) 
      
      avs_recv_and_play_response_threaded()
      - Audio received (from RPI): 8-bit u-law, 16KHZ, mono (1-channel)
      - Audio played (to speaker): 16-bit PCM, 16KHZ, stereo (2-channels)  
      
      Notes
      - G711 u-law lossless companding (compression/expanding) algorithm is used to convert data stream from 16-bit to 8-bit and vice versa. Compressing the data before transmission reduces the data bandwidth usage by half.
      - Converting stereo data stream to mono data stream is done by averaging the consecutive left and right 16-bits WORDS.


### Test Mode and Test Simulator

The FT900 application provides option to choose from any pre-recorded audio for testing convenience.

A Python script application named FT900 Alexa Simulator is also provided to simulate the behavior of FT900 on a Windows machine.

      - It can be run on Windows and Linux machine.
      - It can assist in automated testing and stress testing of RPI Alexa Gateway.



# RPI-side (Alexa Gateway)

Amazon provides an official [Alexa Voice Service (AVS) SDK](https://github.com/alexa/avs-device-sdk), (written in C++). The version I am now using is version v1.12.0 AVS SDK. Instructions to install the AVS SDK on RPI can also be found on the github link.

Below is a system diagram of AVS SDK.
<img src="https://github.com/richmondu/FT900/blob/master/Alexa/Amazon%20Alexa%20Client/docs/images/system_diagram_avs.jpg" width="623"/>

Below is a block diagram showing the implemented components of the RPI application.
<img src="https://github.com/richmondu/FT900/blob/master/Alexa/Amazon%20Alexa%20Client/docs/images/block_diagram_rpi.jpg" width="623"/>

      - Note that audio from Alexa is MP3 for dialogue responses 
      - But can be MP3/AAC or other audio formats for contents (music, live news, audio book) and alerts (alarms, timers).


Below is a sequence diagram showing the basic interaction of components of the RPI application.
<img src="https://github.com/richmondu/FT900/blob/master/Alexa/Amazon%20Alexa%20Client/docs/images/sequence_diagram_rpi.jpg" width="623"/>

      - Note that this diagram is only applicable for Dialogue responses. 
      - For Contents (music, live news, audio book) and Alerts (alarms, timers), MediaPlayer is hooked instead of SpeechSynthesizer.
      

      1. A ConnectionHandler thread is initialized in the main function of the AVS SDK SampleApplication.
      2. The ConnectionHandler thread waits for an FT900 connection.
      3. Once an FT900 connected, it initializes two threads, FT900RequestHandler and FT900ResponseHandler.
      4. FT900RequestHandler handles the processing of Alexa requests from FT900.
      5. FT900ResponseHandler handles the processing of Alexa responses to FT900.
      6. Only 1 FT900 can connect at a time.
      7. FT900RequestHandler receives Alexa request (8-bit compressed using ulaw algorithm) from FT900.
      8. FT900RequestHandler decompresses/expands the Alexa request from 8-bit to 16-bit.
      9. FT900RequestHandler copies the data stream to the microphone input data buffer in PortAudioMicrophoneWrapper.
      10. The Alexa request is then sent to the cloud and receives the Alexa response which is in MP3 format.
      11. SpeechSynthesizer copies the data stream to an MP3 file.
      12. SpeechSynthesizer converts the Alexa response from MP3 format to raw PCM format in a separate thread.
      13. SpeechSynthesizer does not play the response since the request is from FT900.
      14. FT900RequestHandler compresses the Alexa response to 8-bit from 16-bit.
      15. FT900RequestHandler sends the Alexa response (8-bit compressed using ulaw algorithm) to FT900.
      16. The ConnectionHandler thread waits until FT900RequestHandler and FT90ResponseHandler terminates.
      17. The ConnectionHandler thread closes the socket once FT900RequestHandler and FT900ResponseHandler threads terminate. 


### Alexa Capabilities

AVS SDK supports 3 major capabilities: 

      1. Dialogs - for dialog/speech/user-interaction directives (SpeechSynthesizer)
      2. Alerts - for timer/alarm directives (Alerts)
      3. Contents - for content/music directives (AudioPlayer)

Previously, only #1 is working on FT900 since I've only hooked into SpeechSynthesizer class of AVS SDK. That is, if you command FT900 to set an alert or play music, the alarm and music is played on RPI, not on FT900.

To support #2 and #3 on FT900, I hooked into the MediaPlayer class of AVS SDK in RPI. So now, if music is playing in FT900 and then some alerts arrive or user speaks in microphone, then music will be paused to give way for those 2. 

      Three main differences on the new approach:
      1. I'm now hooking on the lower stack of AVS SDK.
         By doing this, I'm able to hook all - Dialogs, Alerts and Contents.
         Previously, I was hooking into Speech Synthesizer which is up in the stack.

      2. I'm now decoding MP3 to RAW chunk by chunk.
         Previously for Dialogs, I save dialog responses completely before decoding as a file.
         This method is not possible with Alerts and Contents, which are streamed, so size cannot be pre-determined.

      3. Connection to RPI is now persistent.
         Previously, connection to RPI was only established when requests are sent.
         This method is no longer possible as Alerts are not active and Contents are long.
   
Below is an experiment that demonstrates the prioritization of Alexa on dialogues responses, alarms and music.

<img src="https://github.com/richmondu/FT900/blob/master/Alexa/Amazon%20Alexa%20Client/docs/images/ft900_simulator_logs.png" width="623"/>

      1. REQUEST_play_music.raw
         I asked Alexa to play music on TuneIn Radio. Music plays.

      2. REQUEST_what_time_is_it.raw
         While music is playing, I asked Alexa what time is it? 
         Music turned off. Alexa replies. Music turned back on.

      3. REQUEST_set_alarm.raw
         While music is playing, I asked Alexa to set alarm in 10 seconds.
         Music turned off. Alexa replies. Music turned back on.
         After 10 seconds, music turned off. Alarms starts running.

      4. REQUEST_what_time_is_it.raw
         While alarm is running, I asked Alexa what time is it?
         Alarm turned off. Alexa replies. Alarm turned back on.

      5. REQUEST_stop.raw
         While alarm is running, I asked Alexa to stop alarm.
         Alarm turned off. Music turned back on.

      6. REQUEST_stop.raw
         While music is playing, I asked Alexa to stop music.
         Music turned off.


### Alexa Audio Content Services

Various audio content services are now working on FT900 microcontroller. 

      1. music radio - TuneIn:  OK
      2. live news   - FoxNews: OK
      3. audio book  - Audible: OK

To support audio book playback, I had to replace libsox with ffmpeg as libsox does NOT support AAC audio format.

Access to other audio services are restricted by Amazon on AVS-SDK. Need to request access to test Spotify, Amazon Music, etc.

### RPI Alexa AVS SDK modifications

In addition to the new modules implemented described in the block diagram and sequence diagram, 
the primary modifications for the AVS SDK application are contained in PortAudioMicrophoneWrapper class, SpeechSynthesizer class and MediaPlayer classes.
 
      - PortAudioMicrophoneWrapper: PortAudioCallback() contains the data stream for Alexa request
      - SpeechSynthesizer: startPlaying() contains the data stream for Dialog (speech response)
      - MediaPlayer: contains the data stream for all audio content including Contents and Alerts

Below is a list of files modified:

      - SampleApplication.cpp: To initialize FT900ConnectionHandler in separate thread.
      - PortAudioMicrophoneWrapper.cpp: To feed in request data to microphone datastream.
      - SpeechSynthesizer.cpp: To hook speech/dialogue response.
      - MediaPlayer.cpp: To fix audiosink issue.
      - IStreamSource.cpp, AttachmentReaderSource.cpp, BaseStreamSource.cpp: to hook contents (music, live news, audio book) and alerts (alarms, timers) 
      - DefaultClient.h: To provide access to Speech Synthesizer handle.
      - UIManager.h: To access connection status and dialog state.
      - UserInputManager.cpp: To test pre-recorded audio requests.

Below is a list of files created:

      - FT900ConnectionHandler.cpp
      - FT900RequestHandler.cpp
      - FT900RequestHook.cpp
      - FT900ResponseHandler.cpp
      - FT900ResponseHook.cpp
      - FT900AudioCompression.cpp
      - FT900AudioCompressionHelper.cpp
      - FT900AudioDecoding.cpp
      - FT900AudioRateConversion.cpp

All of new files starts with FT900 to easily distinguish it from original AVS SDK files. 

After modifications, the total size of the binary executable is 16.2MB.


### Audio Processing 

Below is a description of how the audio is processed on RPI.

      avs_request()
      - Audio received (from FT900): 8-bit u-law, 16KHZ, mono (1-channel)
      - Audio sent (to Alexa cloud): 16-bit PCM, 16KHZ, mono (1-channel)

      avs_response()
      - Audio received (from Alexa cloud): MP3
      - Audio sent (to FT900): 8-bit u-law, 16KHZ, mono (1-channel)

      Notes
      - G711 u-law lossless companding (compression/expanding) algorithm is used to convert data stream from 16-bit to 8-bit and vice versa. Compressing the data before transmission reduces the data bandwidth usage by half.
      - SOX utility is used to convert MP3 data stream to raw PCM16 data stream. SOX has been replaced by FFMPEG to support various audio formats, such as AAC, which is not supported by SOX.


# Performance analysis/optimization

### A. Optimization efforts

Below are the major performance optimization efforts implemented for the demo.

      1. 8-bit ulaw audio compression
      - audio is compressed from 16-bit to 8-bit using G711 ulaw lossless algorithm before transmitting to FT900 or RPI.

      2. 16khz audio sampling rate
      - sample i2s master applications only support 44.1khz and 48khz. size of 48khz is 3 times as much as 16khz.

      3. receive and play Alexa response without saving to SD card
      - this improved FT900-RPI-AVS-RPI-FT900 round trip from 6-7 seconds to 4 seconds.
      - audio quality did not degrade because FIFO size of i2s master is maximized
      
      4. disable playback of response on RPI when request is from FT900
      - RPI should only play response when the request is from RPI microphone.


### B. RPI

One round trip of Alexa request and Alexa response on the RPI side (RPI-AVS-RPI) is about 3.2 seconds (now optimized to 2.6 seconds).
This is for a simple command, "What time is it?". 
This measures the time RPI accepts FT900 connection until it closes the connection.

<img src="https://github.com/richmondu/FT900/blob/master/Alexa/Amazon%20Alexa%20Client/docs/images/rpi_logs.png" width="623"/>

Note that the logs correspond to the sequence diagram above.


### C. FT900

One round trip of Alexa request and Alexa response on the FT900 side (FT900-RPI-AVS-RPI-FT900) is 5-6 seconds.
This has been optimized from 6-7 seconds.
This measurement is for a simple command, "What time is it?". 
This measures the time FT900 sends the Alexa request to RPI until it finishes playing Alexa response.
It takes 4.0 seconds to wait and receive the Alexa response. On RPI side, this is 3.2 seconds so it means FT900 consumes 0.8 second processing overhead.

<img src="https://github.com/richmondu/FT900/blob/master/Alexa/Amazon%20Alexa%20Client/docs/images/ft900_logs.png" width="623"/>

Since the delay is in the processing of Alexa response, one alternative solution is to play the audio stream directly to the speaker without saving it to the SD card. By doing this, performance on the FT900 side (FT900-RPI-AVS-RPI-FT900) has been optimized to 4-5 seconds. This is a major performance improvement. And audio quality is actually very good. Audio quality did not degrade or cause jittering.

<img src="https://github.com/richmondu/FT900/blob/master/Alexa/Amazon%20Alexa%20Client/docs/images/ft900_logs2.png" width="623"/>

Below are the three modes supported for processing Alexa responses.

      1. recv and play by completely saving response to sd card before playing
      - good. (performance 7seconds)
      #define USE_RECVPLAY_RESPONSE 0

      2. recv and play directly without saving to SD card
      - good and faster. default (performance 4seconds)
      #define USE_RECVPLAY_RESPONSE 1

      3. recv and play in separate threads
      - new; not so good (performance 5-6seconds)
      #define USE_RECVPLAYTHREADED_RESPONSE 1


# Audio quality analysis

### A. FT900 Speaker playback

Playback of Alexa response on connected speaker is very very good. There is no noise or jittering. It is very smooth.

This was made possible by maximizing the FIFO buffer sizes for both SD Host (4KB) and I2S Master (2KB).
4KB data is read from SD card then segmented into 4 1KBs. 
Each 1KB data is converted from mono (1-channel) to stereo (2-channels).
This results to 2KB stereo data which is then written to I2S Master speaker. 
The process is repeated until the recorded audio file is completely processed.

When streaming the Alexa response directly to the speaker without saving to SD card,
512 bytes is received from RPI, then expanded from 8-bit to 16-bit (1KB), then converted mono to stereo (2KB).
This is an efficient transfer because I2S Master FIFO size is only 2KB.


### B. FT900 Microphone recording

Recording of Alexa request on FT900 microphone is good. Background noise can be heard but voice pops out when user speaks very near to microphone.



# PanL Smart Home Adoption analysis

### A. RS485 small bandwidth issue

The demo currently uses Ethernet for communication between RPI and FT900. 
For PanL, where communication medium is RS485, bandwidth is smaller, about 92KBps only. 
This is one of the major concerns for adoption of the solution to PanL Smart Home Solution.
Below is an analysis that answers this concern.

The size of an 8-bit 16khz response for a simple question "What time is it?" is less than 32kb. This is sent in 2ms.
30720bytes *1000/2ms=15360000 (14.6 MBps)

To simulate RS485 slowness, I added delay between each send (note that 32kb is sent in chunks as it is compressed in chunks).
Results:

      1) 20ms delay => response is sent in about 1sec instead of 2ms. (32k bytes/sec) *causes stutter
      2) 13ms delay => response is sent in about 660ms instead of 2ms. (48k bytes/sec)
      3) 10ms delay => response is sent in about 500ms instead of 2ms. (64k bytes/sec)
      4)  6ms delay => response is sent in about 330ms instead of 2ms. (96k bytes/sec)

The 20ms added delay sometimes causes a stutter for recv_and_play_no_sdcard option as sender becomes slow.
Meaning, using SD card to save response is necessary when sender rate is around 32KBps only.

But since the acceptable computed rate for RS485 is 64KBps (70% of 92KBps), then not using SD card to save response is still OK.
If we use SD card to save response, then RS485 is not a even problem. 

Note that the demo solution provides both options to save or not to save response to SD card. 
(Saving response to SD card is 1-2 seconds slower than NOT saving response to SD card.)


### B. CPU usage issue

Another concern is the CPU usage consumed by the application on RPI. 

Based on observation, the CPU usage jumps to 20-30% for a split second when processing a request. This is OK. 
Note that no AI is done on the RPI. 
The Alexa SDK only forwards the request on the cloud where the AI-generated response is created. 
So the Alexa application on RPI does NOT and can NOT hog the CPU.

            Usage:
            Press 'r' to start/stop voice recording.
            Press 't' to ask current time.
            Press 'p' to ask who is Lebron James.
            Press 'm' to play music from TuneIn radio.
            Press 'n' to play live news from Fox News.
            Press 'b' to play audio book from Audible.
            Press 'a' to set alarm in 10 seconds.
            Press 's' to tell stop.
            Press 'y' to tell yes.
            Press 'q' to quit and restart.

OLD:

      A. Test Mode (Use a pre-recorded request contained in SD card)
      1. Change AVS_CONFIG_SERVER_ADDR in avs_config.h.
         This should contain the IP address of the RPI
      2. Copy test/request.raw to SD card.
         request.raw is an audio recording of "What time is it?"
      3. Compile and run.
         This automatically sends the pre-recorded audio, request.raw, to RPI.

      B. Normal Mode (User presses a key or button to trigger voice recording)
      1. Change AVS_CONFIG_SERVER_ADDR to avs_config.h.
         This should contain the IP address of the RPI
      2. Change TEST_MODE to 0 in main.
      3. (Optional) Change USE_GPIO to 1 in button.c.
         (Optional) Connect button to GPIO 31, 5V and GND.
         (Optional) Default is UART instead of GPIO.
      4. Compile and run.
      5. For UART mode, Press 't' to start recording voice command.
         For GPIO mode, press the button.
      6. For UART mode, press 't' again to stop recording voice command.
         For GPIO mode, release the button.
      7. After stopping the recording, FT900 will send the voice request to RPI.



# Action items

Below are the action items for the Alexa Demo.

      1. Support for wake-word detection in FT900. Currently, user has to press down a button to start voice recording.
      2. Support for multiple FT900 clients. (Multiple FT900 should be able to simultaneously send requests to RPI. RPI should queue the requests and only issue a request when a response for previous request is processed.)
      3. Use 8KHz instead of 16KHz in FT900 to further reduce audio transmitted size by half. (However, note that RPI will have to convert the 8KHz to 16KHz as Alexa cloud requires 16KHz).
      4. Use GSTREAMER instead of FFmpeg to decode data for FT900.
